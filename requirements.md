# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an end-to-end speech-to-reasoning pipeline that combines OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) with a quantized large language model for reasoning tasks. The system will be implemented in Google Colab and will process audio input, transcribe it to text, and then use that transcription as input for logical reasoning or question-answering tasks using an efficient, memory-optimized quantized model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to input audio queries and receive reasoned responses, so that I can interact with AI systems using natural speech input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file is provided as input THEN the system SHALL transcribe the audio to text using OpenAI's Whisper
2. WHEN the transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL pass the text to a quantized reasoning model
3. WHEN the reasoning model processes the text THEN the system SHALL return a logical response or answer
4. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL complete the full process in a single Google Colab notebook

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use memory-efficient quantized models, so that I can run the pipeline on limited GPU resources in Colab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the reasoning model THEN the system SHALL use a quantized model (4-bit or similar)
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL manage GPU memory efficiently
3. WHEN the model is loaded THEN the system SHALL use proper quantization setup (e.g., Unsloth dynamic 4-bit)
4. IF GPU memory is limited THEN the system SHALL handle memory constraints gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various audio formats and lengths, so that I can use different types of audio input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio input is provided THEN the system SHALL support common audio formats (wav, mp3, m4a)
2. WHEN processing long audio files THEN the system SHALL handle them without memory overflow
3. WHEN audio quality varies THEN the system SHALL still produce usable transcriptions
4. WHEN no audio is detected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient batching and encoding handling, so that the system can process requests optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper batching strategies
2. WHEN encoding text for the LLM THEN the system SHALL handle tokenization efficiently
3. WHEN managing model inputs THEN the system SHALL optimize for the specific model architecture
4. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL maintain response quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a complete working demonstration, so that I can understand how to use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the notebook is executed THEN the system SHALL provide a sample audio query demonstration
2. WHEN demonstrating the pipeline THEN the system SHALL show each step clearly (transcription → reasoning → response)
3. WHEN running the demo THEN the system SHALL include performance metrics and timing information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be easily configurable, so that I can experiment with different models and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the pipeline THEN the system SHALL allow easy model selection (Llama, Qwen, etc.)
2. WHEN configuring Whisper THEN the system SHALL support different model sizes and languages
3. WHEN adjusting quantization THEN the system SHALL provide configurable precision settings
4. WHEN modifying prompts THEN the system SHALL allow customizable reasoning templates
